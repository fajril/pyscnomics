    Perform summation operation on two arrays, accounting for different starting years.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array1 : np.ndarray
        The first input array for summation.
    array2 : np.ndarray
        The second input array for summation.
    startYear1 : int
        The starting year of data in array1.
    startYear2 : int
        The starting year of data in array2.
    endYear1: int (optional)
        The end year of data in array1.
    endYear2: int (optional)
        The end year of data in array1.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        An array containing the result of element-wise summation of array1 and array2,
        start_year and end_year.
        The years are aligned according to the starting year of each input array.

    Notes
    -----
    This function performs element-wise summation on array1 and array2, taking into account
    their respective starting years. The result array will span from the minimum starting
    year to the maximum ending year of the input arrays.
